/**
 * @name PopoverController
 * @description
 * A Popover is a dialog that appears on top of the current page.
 * It can be used for anything, but generally it is used for overflow
 * actions that don't fit in the navigation bar.
 *
 * ### Creating
 * A popover can be created by calling the `create` method. The view
 * to display in the popover should be passed as the first argument.
 * Any data to pass to the popover view can optionally be passed in
 * the second argument. Options for the popover can optionally be
 * passed in the third argument. See the [create](#create)
