    <p style="text-align: justify">We are a small group of university software development students engaged in a project for a mobile applications module. We are developing this project whilst trying to get to grips with the Ionic/Angular framework used for mobile-apps along with mobile programming interfaces (APIs) and various other fundamentals of hybrid app development.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">We decided on this quiz for our project. The scope of it is as a light time-filler if someone is waiting for a bus or waiting to start some other activity. There is an element of competition with the lives feature as well as scores produced at the end. There are a number of categories to choose from with ten questions posed in each category.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center">We hope you enjoy! </h3>
