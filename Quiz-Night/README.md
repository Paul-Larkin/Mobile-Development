# Quiz Night
This was a mobile application created as a group project during our Higher Diploma in Software Development.

## Functionalities:
* We used a quiz API to import quiz questions and answers
* We implemented a score component to keep track of correct answers
* We also included a lives component, which appear as full hearts or heart outlines in the app, depending on if a life was lost or not.

My main role in this project was developing the score and lives components. I also helped out a bit with the API as we were struggling to get it working at first.
